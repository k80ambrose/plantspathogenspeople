    <h1>Botrytis Cinerea!</h1>
        <p>
            Botrytis Cinerea, commonly known as gray mold, is a fungal pathogen that significantly affects global agriculture, impacting a wide variety of host crops at various stages of growth.

                    <h2>Virulent Pathogen</h2>
                    <p>Fungicides? The use of fungicides has been shown to be partially effective against B. cinerea. However, these have not proven adequate for controlling the spread of infection. As of now, there is no perfect solution for managing the presence of the pathogen once it infects, so targeting the other legs of the disease triangle are the best ways to prevent spread of the infection. </p>

                    <h2>Conducive Environment</h2>
                    <p>Limit humidity! High humidity leads to a much more rapid spread of infection. In low humidity environments the patches of the decay can be contained and localized to individual spots. The fungus can form black seed-like structures which appear on leaves and branches and are often overlooked signs.</p>

                    <h2>Susceptible Host</h2>
                    <p>Remove dead plants! As a necrotrophic pathogen, dead plants are prime sources of infection for B. cinerea. Especially in enclosed greenhouses, making sure to remove dead plants from the environment is an important step in limiting hosts susceptible to infection.</p>

    <h2>Host Crops</h2>
        <p>[insert body text here]
        </p>
    <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>
        <p>
            The signs and symptoms of B. cinerea vary slightly depending on the host plant. In grapes, it causes a condition called noble rot, which is actually sought after in the production of some sweet wines. In most cases, however, the infection is unwanted. The first signs are often soft brown spots on the fruits, leaves, or stems. These spots may develop a gray mycelium as the spores proliferate.<br><br>In strawberries, symptoms often include a soft brown rot and the same telltale gray mold. On leaves, Botrytis infection can cause a blight that forms lesions and can lead to leaf dieback. The spores of the fungus are spread by wind or water splash and can infect through wounds or directly penetrate the softer tissues of the plant.<br><br>High humidity and cool temperatures favor the development of the disease, with the spores germinating in water film on the plant surfaces. The fungus is also known for its ability to hibernate in plant debris and soil, making it a recurring problem for some farmers. Managing the environmental conditions that favor the pathogen is key to controlling its spread.

    <h2>Disease Management</h2>
        <p>
            Effective disease management strategies for B. cinerea focus on a combination of cultural, biological, and chemical approaches. Culturally, reducing humidity and increasing air circulation around the plants can greatly minimize the prevalence of the disease. Pruning and the removal of infected plant debris reduce the fungal inoculum, while appropriate spacing of plants prevents the easy transfer of the disease.<br><br>Biologically, employing antagonistic organisms that naturally suppress Botrytis cinerea can be a sustainable method of control. For instance, the use of bacterial or fungal antagonists that compete with or inhibit the growth of the pathogen has shown to be effective in some cases.<br><br>Chemically, the application of fungicides remains a common practice, but it must be done judiciously to prevent the development of resistant strains of the pathogen. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies that rotate between different classes of fungicides can help delay or prevent the development of resistance.<br><br>Moreover, breeding for resistant varieties and the use of biotechnological tools for genetic improvement of plants provide long-term solutions for managing gray mold. The development of resistant cultivars, through traditional breeding methods or genetic engineering, can significantly reduce the dependency on chemical treatments and promote a more sustainable agricultural practice.<br><br>

    <h2>Recent Research Findings</h2>
        <p>
            Current antifungals used against Botrytis cinerea are ineffective, both in that the pathogen tends to quickly develop resistance and they cause harmful side effects on the environment. A recent study by De Angelis, G., Simonetti, G., Chronopoulou, L. et al.  explores the potential for using poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (PLGA NPs) as less environmentally impactful antifungals.<br><br> NPs have already been shown to have a negligible impact on the environment. Additionally, they have been shown to be able to enter grape vine cells without disruption to cellular function. They have been studied for the fact that they can be used for controlled deployment of bioactive particles.<br><br>Their findings show promising results for a new potential management strategy against B. cinerea. They represent an alternative area of future development for the creation of compounds to control fungal infections.
